/*
 * Revisit what you've just seen in the slides, as well as the previous labs. Try to implement an Option type based on
 * what you've learned. If you (and your colleagues) are stuck, you can get a Hint in package little.help
 *
 * Hint: Be careful about name clashes with Scala's standard library types
 *
 * Optional: Once your done, look at MyOptionTest, copy it to package com.scigility.lab.lab06.from.scratch in
 * src/test/scala, and try adapt it so that it tests your solution (i.e. change package and type names accordingly,
 * and see if it runs)
